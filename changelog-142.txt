2.08e
Fusion Reactor + Redstone = Stops emitting Energy
Buffers/Translocators/Sorters are now able to keep track with Induction Furnaces.

2.08d

Added API for JackHammerable Blocks.
Added Config for the constant need of Energy.

2.08b
Removed the ID-Resolver-blockade in this Version
Added electric Blast Furnace. You may see, how to build it inside its GUI.
Fixed baturinskys strange Bug, with the middle Blocks of the Grinder. The Water was the problem, obviously as soon as you Block-Update Water/Lava it gets another ID to indicate that it should now move/flow, and I didnt check for these additional Block-Update-ID's.

2.08a
Added Industrial Grinder, it can only macerate Ores. Its a Multiblock Structure, so you need much space for it. The Multiblockconstruction can be shared between up to 4 Grinders, what is just like upgrading the Machine. It needs 12800EU at 128EU/t to process the Ores.
Added Machine Casing in 3 diffrent Tiers.
Added Steel and Brass Blocks.
Fixed a few Bugs.
Made Diamond Drill more expensive.
Added ridiculous alternate Recipe for Macerator, which saves 0.5 Diamonds at the cost of Steel/Refined Iron, but only if you craft two Macerators.

Fixed Capes
Fixed Diamondmaceration
Fixed Beacon-Blocks

2.07b

Added Steel Dust/Ingot, its recipe is only enabled if Railcraft is NOT installed.
Fixed Sorter outputting Stuff into the opposite side.

2.07a
Added Crop Harvestor.
Added Scrapboxinator. It was planned to turn anything into Scrapboxes with it, but due to a minor malfunction it just unpacks Scrapboxes.
Added Diamond Blade as new Component for a few Machines (currently only Crop Harvestor, but you can guess what the Sawmill will need).

2.06c
Fixed a bunch of Clientside Bugs, including Progressbars and MetatileEntity-GUI's (it updates on Rightclick, so the Texture is may Adv Machine until you click).
Added additional Drops for some Ores. You will see them, when you harvest them. I have to update the Wikipage about it, as I changed something to the Drops. And yes, they are Fortune-Compatible (like Flint should be for Gravel)
Minor Tweaks.

2.06b
Fusionreactor outputs empty Cells in the same Slot as the regular Output, you just have to grab it automatically.
Fusion is buffed, 2 times longer and 8 times more Energy. Now you need a Supercondensator to run it properly.
Added small Dusts of pretty much everything. 4 of them make a full one. Some of them even have special Recipes.

2.06a
Added Industrial Electrolyzer, crafted of Extractor, Magnetizer, IC²-Electrolyzer, Tier-IV-Circuitry and Aluminium or Refined Iron
Moved tons of Recipes from the Centriuge to the ~10 times faster Electrolyzer.
Electrolyzer accepts MV btw.

Added a new Component, the monitor. Its now used for Computers and similar Devices.
Added Oredictsupport for the Miner of IC². When your log says, that there is an unknown Ore, please tell it to me. It will still be registered at the Miner, but with a Value of 1

2.04b
Added Tungsten Dust, Diamond Dust (now needed for the Rockcutter), Tungsten Ingot (from centrifuging Lava) and 6 completly useless dusts, which arent my fault as these are perparation for EcsWhyCraft.
Added Lazurite Chunk as replacement for Lapisblocks in some recipes like the one form the LESU or the Lappack.

2.04a
Fixed Creativetabs of the Blocks.
Added Langfile for Items and Blocks.
Fixed a few other crashes.

2.03c
Various fixes
Creativetab
Added Saltpeter to the output of the Soulssand-Centrifugation

2.03b
Added Pyrite-Ore in the Nether. The Pyritedust is like the one from centrifuging Lapis and gives you 1/3 Irondust and 2/3 Sulfur.
Fixed Oredictionarynames from those Hipsters, who think "itemDust" is the correct prefix, by reregistering those with a "dust"-prefix.
Textures of a few Blocks were slightly changed.

2.03a
I will adjust the Exception thrown when a nullpointer occurs to mention ID-Resolver, and i will use the BlockID inside the Block instead of my Configvalue.

2.02c
After seeing a random Modspotlight, i added Electrum Ingot/Dust. Crafted out of Gold and Silver Dust. Electrum is now used instead of Gold inside my Machinerecipes and instead of Silver in the cheaper Circuitry. That was the use for Gold i was looking for.

2.02b
Fixed mistaqurs Problem probably
Added Mortar to make Dusts out of Ingots/Coal. Not all Ingots are possible, some are too dense.

2.02a
Added ElectricSorter. Works similar to the Translocator, but has a variable second Outputfacing for the sorted Items.

2.01c
Added Rockbreaker! An electric Cobblegenerator.

2.01b
Btw. GregTech-Sensorcards are now added as of V2.01b.

2.01a
Added two new Blocks for Automation, the Advanced Translocator, which works like Sneakypipes, and the Advanced Buffer, which is able to put Items into a specific Slot (very usefull for Reactors!).

2.00d
shouldve fixed the other two Bugs

2.00c
Mainly Bugfixes.

2.00b
ItemID's are now massively improved. This Version will be upwardscompatible.

2.00a Beta
Port to Minecraft 1.4.2 and IC2 1.108
Oregeneration works fine. Some Rightclickactions of Items (Sonictron, Debugscanner, Dataorb) are broken.
Some Items will no longer work after the next Update. I'm talking about: Dusts, Cells, Ingots, Circuitry and Gems. Basically all stupid Resource-ITEMS (not Blocks like the Ores). I recommend you, to not harvest Gems without Rockcutter or to macerate Bauxite, the Items they drop will no longer be valid in 2.00b.
